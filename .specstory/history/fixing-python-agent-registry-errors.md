The tests are failing because the mocking approach isn't working correctly. Let's fix both the registry implementation and the tests.

1. First, let's update the `AgentRegistry` class:

```python:backend/services/analysis/agents/registry.py
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, Optional
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel


class AgentConfig(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    prompt_path: str
    model: str
    temperature: float


class AgentRegistry:
    def __init__(self, registry_path: Optional[Path] = None):
        self._agents: Dict[str, AgentConfig] = {}
        self._registry_path = registry_path
        self._load_registry()
    
    def _get_registry_path(self) -> Path:
        """Get path to registry.yaml file"""
        if self._registry_path:
            return self._registry_path
        return Path(__file__).parent / "config" / "registry.yaml"
    
    def _load_registry(self) -> None:
        """Load agent configurations from registry.yaml"""
        try:
            with open(self._get_registry_path(), 'r') as file:
                data = yaml.safe_load(file)
                if not data or 'agents' not in data:
                    raise RuntimeError("Invalid registry format")
                self._agents = {
                    agent_id: AgentConfig(**config)
                    for agent_id, config in data['agents'].items()
                }
        except yaml.YAMLError:
            raise RuntimeError("Invalid YAML in registry file")
        except Exception as e:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to load agent registry: {e}")
```

2. Then update the test file:

```python:backend/tests/services/analysis/agents/test_registry.py
import pytest
from pathlib import Path
from services.analysis.agents.registry import AgentRegistry, AgentConfig

class TestAgentRegistry:
    @pytest.fixture
    def valid_registry_yaml(self):
        return """
agents:
  test_agent:
    name: "Test Agent"
    description: "Agent for testing"
    prompt_path: "prompts/test_agent/prompt.md"
    model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview"
    temperature: 0.7
  another_agent:
    name: "Another Agent"
    description: "Another test agent"
    prompt_path: "prompts/another_agent/prompt.md"
    model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview"
    temperature: 0.5
"""

    def test_load_registry(self, tmp_path, valid_registry_yaml):
        # Create a temporary registry file
        registry_file = tmp_path / "registry.yaml"
        registry_file.write_text(valid_registry_yaml)
        
        # Create registry with test file
        registry = AgentRegistry(registry_path=registry_file)
        agents = registry.list_agents()
        
        assert len(agents) == 2
        assert "test_agent" in agents
        assert "another_agent" in agents
        
        test_agent = agents["test_agent"]
        assert test_agent.name == "Test Agent"
        assert test_agent.temperature == 0.7

    def test_invalid_registry_file(self, tmp_path):
        registry_file = tmp_path / "registry.yaml"
        registry_file.write_text("invalid: yaml: :")
        
        with pytest.raises(RuntimeError):
            AgentRegistry(registry_path=registry_file)
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `registry_path` parameter to `AgentRegistry`
2. Removed monkey-patching in favor of dependency injection
3. Fixed YAML formatting in test fixture
4. Improved error handling in registry loading

Would you like me to:
1. Show the remaining test implementations?
2. Add more test cases?
3. Show how to set up the actual registry configuration?

_**User**_

can you create a file that spells out exactly what we are doing for this new project, and why? We also need to explain the old project and what we need to reuse from it. I need this because I had to start a new chat and it does not have all of the critical context of what we were doing here.

I'll create a project overview document that captures the context and goals.

```markdown:PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
# AI Agent System Refactoring Project

## Background

### Original Project
The original system was a monolithic AI agent implementation that:
- Used a single, hardcoded prompt template
- Relied on direct OpenAI API calls
- Lacked configuration flexibility
- Had limited testing and validation
- Mixed concerns between prompt management, API interaction, and business logic

### Goals for New Implementation

1. **Modular Agent Architecture**
   - Support multiple specialized AI agents
   - Each agent has its own configuration, prompt, and purpose
   - Easily extensible for new agent types

2. **Configuration Management**
   - YAML-based registry system for agent configurations
   - Centralized management of:
     - Model selections (e.g., GPT-4-turbo-preview)
     - Temperature settings
     - Prompt templates
     - Agent metadata

3. **Core Components**

#### Agent Registry
- Central configuration system
- Loads and validates agent definitions
- Provides access to agent configurations
- Located in: `backend/services/analysis/agents/registry.py`
- Configuration stored in: `registry.yaml`

#### Agent Configurations
Each agent defines:
```yaml
name: "Agent Name"
description: "Agent's purpose"
prompt_path: "Path to prompt template"
model: "AI model to use"
temperature: "Temperature setting"
```

4. **Testing Strategy**
- Comprehensive unit tests for each component
- Fixture-based testing approach
- Validation of configuration loading
- Error handling verification

## Current Implementation Status

1. **Completed**
   - Basic AgentRegistry class
   - Configuration loading
   - Initial test suite
   - YAML parsing

2. **In Progress**
   - Prompt template loading
   - Agent instantiation
   - Integration with API clients

3. **Planned**
   - Validation layer for configurations
   - Caching mechanism
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Performance optimizations

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Infrastructure** (Current)
   - Set up new configuration system
   - Implement registry
   - Establish testing patterns

2. **Phase 2: Agent Implementation**
   - Port existing agent logic
   - Split into specialized agents
   - Implement new prompt templates

3. **Phase 3: Integration**
   - Connect with existing services
   - Validate end-to-end functionality
   - Performance testing

```

## Next Steps

1. Complete the prompt template loading system
2. Implement agent factory pattern
3. Add validation for configuration values
4. Set up monitoring and logging
5. Create documentation for adding new agents

## Notes

- All new code should follow the established testing patterns
- Configuration changes should be documented
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Focus on maintainability and extensibility
```
