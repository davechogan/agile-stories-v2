# Architecture Upgrade Path

This document outlines the ordered sequence for implementing architectural improvements to the Agile Stories application.

## 1. Core Infrastructure Updates ✅
- Add API Gateway integration ✅
  - Set up REST API endpoints ✅
  - Update Lambda integrations ✅
  - Update frontend to use API Gateway endpoints ✅
- Implement multi-tenant support ✅
  - Add tenantId to all data structures ✅
  - Update Lambda functions to handle tenantId ✅
  - Modify queries to filter by tenantId ✅
- Split into two DynamoDB tables ✅
  - Create separate tables for stories and estimates ✅
  - Migrate existing data ✅
  - Update Lambda functions to use appropriate tables ✅

## 2. Workflow Orchestration 🔄
- Implement AWS Step Functions
  - Define state machine for story progression
    - Story Analysis Flow
      - Submit Story → Analyze → Update Status
    - Team Estimation Flow
      - Request Estimates → Collect Responses → Calculate Final
    - Technical Review Flow
      - Submit Review → Process → Update Story
  - Replace SQS orchestration
  - Add error handling and retry logic
  - Update Lambda functions to work with Step Functions
  - Add monitoring for workflow states

## 3. Real-time Updates
- Add AppSync for GraphQL API
  - Define GraphQL schema
  - Implement resolvers
  - Add subscriptions for real-time status updates
  - Remove polling mechanism
  - Update frontend to use GraphQL/subscriptions

## 4. Settings & Configuration
- Add Settings functionality
  - Create Settings page in frontend
  - Implement team size/role configuration
  - Add points vs days toggle
  - Create settings storage in DynamoDB
  - Update Lambda functions to use dynamic settings

## 5. Security & Authentication
- Implement authentication system
  - Set up Cognito user pools
  - Add IAM roles and policies
  - Implement row-level security in DynamoDB
  - Add encryption for sensitive data
  - Update frontend to handle auth

## 6. Monitoring & Observability
- Add comprehensive monitoring
  - Implement structured logging
  - Set up CloudWatch metrics
  - Create monitoring dashboards
  - Configure alarms
  - Add performance tracking

## Implementation Notes
- Each phase should be implemented as a separate branch
- Testing should be done at each phase
- Documentation should be updated with each change
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Consider creating feature flags for gradual rollout

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 is required for all other phases
- Phase 2 (Step Functions) and 3 (AppSync) can be done in parallel
- Phase 4 (Settings) requires Phase 1 completion
- Phase 5 (Security) should be implemented before production deployment
- Phase 6 (Monitoring) can be implemented incrementally throughout

## Success Criteria
Each phase should be considered complete when:
- All new features are tested
- Documentation is updated
- Existing functionality is maintained
- Performance metrics are acceptable
- Security requirements are met
