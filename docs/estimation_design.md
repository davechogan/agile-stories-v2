# Estimation System Design

## Overview
The estimation system uses multiple AI agents to simulate different team roles analyzing and estimating stories. Estimates are processed in parallel and aggregated into final story points and dev days.

## Components

### 1. Estimation Roles
Available roles for estimation:
- Senior Developer
- Mid-level Developer
- Junior Developer
- Solution Architect
- QA Engineer
- DevOps Engineer
- Technical Lead
- Product Analyst

Each role provides unique perspectives and considerations in their estimates.

### 2. Estimation Process
1. Story is submitted for estimation
2. Selected roles analyze in parallel
3. Each role provides:
   - Story points (Fibonacci)
   - Dev days (decimal)
   - Confidence level
   - Concerns/risks
   - Assumptions
4. Results are aggregated:
   - Story points use Fibonacci averaging
   - Dev days use decimal averaging

### 3. Settings Management
Administrators can configure:
- Active estimation roles
- Estimation types (points/days)
- Team composition
- Default settings

## Data Structures

```typescript
interface EstimationRole {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'SENIOR' | 'MID' | 'JUNIOR' | 'ARCHITECT' | 'QA' | 'DEVOPS' | 'TECH_LEAD' | 'PRODUCT';
  active: boolean;
}

interface EstimateResult {
  role: string;
  storyPoints: number;
  devDays: number;
  confidence: number;
  concerns?: string[];
  assumptions?: string[];
}

interface EstimationSettings {
  useStoryPoints: boolean;
  useDevDays: boolean;
  selectedRoles: string[];
  defaultConfidenceThreshold: number;
}
```

## Processing Flow
1. Technical review completed
2. Estimation triggered
3. Parallel processing of estimates
4. Results aggregation
5. Final estimate presentation
